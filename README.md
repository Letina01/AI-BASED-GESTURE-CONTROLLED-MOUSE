# AI-BASED-GESTURE-CONTROLLED-MOUSE
This project enables users to control their computer using hand gestures and voice commands. It integrates computer vision for hand tracking and a personal AI assistant (Proton) to execute system commands, launch the gesture-controlled mouse, and perform various personal tasks.

Features
âœ… Gesture-Based Mouse Control â€“ Move the cursor, click, scroll, and perform other actions using hand gestures.
âœ… Voice Assistant (Proton) â€“ Execute voice commands for system control.
âœ… AI-Based Hand Tracking â€“ Uses OpenCV and MediaPipe for accurate hand detection.
âœ… Speech Recognition â€“ Uses Google Speech API or Whisper AI for voice command processing.
âœ… Customizable Actions â€“ Modify and expand voice and gesture-based commands.

Tech Stack
Python
OpenCV (for image processing)
Mediapipe (for hand tracking)
PyAutoGUI (for automating mouse actions)
SpeechRecognition (for voice input)
NLTK / GPT-based AI (for AI assistant response)
